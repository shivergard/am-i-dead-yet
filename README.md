creepy , but might feed my paranoid fears :P

Larger paranoya than Data security for me is that , when I'll be unlinked* data/things that need to be hidden will be too open , but data that I would not share while I'm linked , but I would like to share in case of my unlinking* would be inaccessible. 

So thinking of script/concept , that could detect my status and sort it out for me :P

Definetly problems I see 
** It must validate my status on trustfull sources ** , so it would not make ... unacceptable actions while I'm linked. So guess it must work on crowd approved approach. That certaint % trustfull people confirm my unexistance.

** It must be stored on costLess enviroment** , so I'll make it as a Heroku webservice.
